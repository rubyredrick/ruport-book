== Ruport Hacking Guide ==

If you've read your way through this book, you probably have a decent grasp on
how to use Ruport.  However, there is power in knowing what lies under the hood.
This appendix will help show you how to work against Ruport's bleeding edge,
and how to hack on the internals as needed.  If you're interested in patching
Ruport to meet some particular need, or you'd like to make a contribution to
our community, this is a must read.

=== Running from Ruport's Edge ===
                        
The first step to hacking on Ruport is of course to get yourself the latest
sources.  Things tend to move reasonably fast in Ruport, so working against
Subversion is a must.  You can always find repository URL listings at 
code.rubyreports.org, but at the time of writing, the locations of trunk for
the various components of Ruby Reports were as follows:
                
*Ruport*

  http://stonecode.svnrepository.com/svn/ruport/ruport/trunk
  
*acts_as_reportable*

  http://stonecode.svnrepository.com/svn/ruport/acts_as_reportable
  
*ruport-util*

  http://stonecode.svnrepository.com/svn/ruport-util/trunk
  
*Ruport/Rails*

  http://stonecode.svnrepository.com/svn/ruport_rails/                    
                       
==== Release Structure ====

All of our packages follow a common release numbering scheme which is meant to 
easily let our users know what kind of release they are using at a glance.

*Stable Releases:*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  a.b.c -> a.b.(c+1) : Bug Fixes.  No API Incompatibility (minor)
  a.b.c -> a.(b+1).c : Feature Enhancements and possible API breakage (major)
  a.b.c -> (a+1).b.c : Huge Milestone. All bets are off. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We always support the latest stable release branch.  As of December 2007
this was Ruport 1.4, and it resides in +/branches/1.4+.  Once a new major stable 
release comes out, the branch effectively becomes obsolete.

We try not to use odd numbers for the middle number in our public releases,
meaning the next stable major release after 1.4.x will likely be 1.6.x

*Beta Releases:*

We will occasionally publish beta gems. They follow the form a.b.rev, where
rev is the SVN revision the gem is built from.  For example, a beta build of 
the 1.4 codebase generated from r1224 would become Ruport 1.3.1224

This numbering scheme makes it very easy to tell both which branch the code is
ultimately going to become a part of, and also approximately what it is in.
Combined with an svn log of trunk, it shouldn't be too hard to keep track of 
what is in the beta builds.

=== Preparing A Patch ===

If you'd like to extend Ruport either for your own use or to contribute back
to the community, you'll find it's easier than you think. 

==== Choose the Right Package ====

Ruport's distribution is split across several packages, and picking the right
one to patch for your new features will help both make your work easier and
increase the likelihood that your patch be accepted if you submit it to us.

What follows is a brief description of each package, so that you have a sense
of where your feature might belong.

*Ruport*

The core Ruport package has become increasingly lean from version to version.
We now basically think of it as a super lightweight base for building actual
tools on top of.  With this in mind, we basically have our core data structures,
some simple controllers, and a few formatters.  As of Ruport 1.4, it should be
easy for anyone to keep most of Ruport's core in their head, which we think is
a good thing.  Basically, the only features which belong in Ruport's core are
the ones so common that most everyone will use them 
(CSV I/O, Tabular Data Structure) and also the ones that provide a solid base 
for extension (PDF Formatter).  Most other features belong in the other packages.   

The Ruport package is currently under a release cycle that supports a 
single stable branch and a main development branch.  Stable branches typically 
last a couple months before being replaced by newer versions from development.  
What this basically means is that it sometimes takes a while for changes in the 
core package to make it out to the general public.

*ruport-util*

The ruport-util package is Ruport's fat cousin, chock full
of pretty much anything that supports Ruport development.  This means that it
is an ideal home for somewhat specialized tools or for formatters and data 
modeling libraries that aren't particularly extensible.  This is also the place
for any command line utilities.  Two such examples currently in 
ruport-util are +rope+ and +csv2ods+.     

The ruport-util package is under a much less structured release cycle, in which
releases typically take place a few days after new functionality is added.
Given the nature of the package as sort of a collection of different tools, this
approach seems to work pretty well.  The only restrictions are that
ruport-util's trunk should run against the latest stable version of Ruport, not
a development version.  When work needs to be done against the bleeding edge,
we'll usually raise branches.

*acts_as_reportable*

Formerly part of core Ruport, acts_as_reportable is our ActiveRecord 
integration.  Essentially, anything specific to AR belongs in this package.

Though you can likely expect more stability than ruport-util, 
acts_as_reportable is also on a rolling release schedule and may
change over time.  

*Ruport/Rails*

Of the four packages mentioned here, Ruport/Rails is the only 'unofficial'
package.  This is a Rails plugin and is meant for any non-AR Rails helpers.  
If you have an extension that is rather specific to Rails that needs a home, 
this may be the right place.

This package is SVN-only, and does not have a formal release schedule.  It is
also still considered to be experimental, but Mike uses it in his day to day
work.   
                                                 
==== Be a Good Patcher ====

Once you've decided which package you'd like to patch, it's time to dig in.                           

*Get up to date*

A first step to take before working on a patch is to check the development
version of the package you're working on to see if it doesn't already have the
feature you need.  We don't announce every feature while we're working on it,
so glancing at the svn log is always a good idea.

*Get in contact*

Once you've verified that your problem still needs solving, please contact us
on the ruport-dev mailing list: http://groups.google.com/group/ruport-dev    

This list is mostly for contributors and developers, and it is where the
implementation details of new features can be discussed.  We will also happily
review any patches you post to this list.  Usually, the best way to get a 
feature into any of our packages is to send a short email describing the 
problem, maybe with some code, or if not, just example usage.

We encourage folks not to worry about perfecting their code before starting up
a discussion with us.  You'll find it a whole lot easier to get a patch together
with a couple Ruport developers helping you along.

*Get your patch applied*

If you're just working on an extension for personal use and don't want to worry
about refining it for use by the general community, that's fine.  However, if
you want your patch to get integrated into the project, there are a few simple
guidelines.
                                             
  * Always send unified diff, as output by +svn diff+.
  * Try to keep your patches small and atomic.            
  * Try to follow good Ruby coding practices, and stick to two space indent.
  * Don't let your patch break our test suite.
  * Make sure your patch has tests of its own, especially if it's a bug fix.      

Once you've prepared a diff file, you're welcome to open up a ticket in Trac
and attach the file there.  You can also send it to the ruport-dev mailing list.
However, if you've put it in the tracker, please mail a link to the mailing list
so we can discuss the patch there. 

We have an open commit policy, so all it takes is one accepted patch to get
you full access to all four packages.  So far, this has worked out great with
our contributors, and hopefully lets people know that anyone is welcome to help
make Ruport better.

=== Power Tools for Ruport Hackers ===

Though this gives you a basic overview of how the project is laid out 
development-wise, it's worth mentioning some interesting bits that are in the 
core Ruport gem and are worth investigating if you're thinking of extending
things.  Listed below are several of the developer conveniences that might
be useful in your work:
                     
==== Data Model ====

  * +Data::Feeder+ can wrap any object that implements +<<+ and +feed_element+.
  * Table accepts +:record_class+, which allows you to use Record 
      subclasses or duck typed objects.  A subclass of Table could set these
      automatically.  For reference see the way graphs are implemented in ruport-util.
  * Records can be reindexed to point at a new set of attribute names, and
    attributes can be deleted via private functions.      

==== Formatting System ====

  * +Formatter::RenderingTools+ contains the definitions for the render_* helpers.
    You can easily use +render_helper()+ in this module to create your own wrappers.
  * You can override +Controller#run()+ to completely change the way the rendering process works.
  * You can use Controller's build method to create a controller instance and tie it to a formatter.
    This allows you to persist a controller instance rather than generating them on the fly, among other things.
  * The PDF formatter has a number of private methods that do primitive manipulations on the document,
    some of these may come in handy for designing advanced components.  
  * +Controller::Hooks+ lets you tie any data structure to the formatting system.

Though these features are quite advanced, they make it possible to significantly
extend and even modify the way core Ruport works without having to uproot the
underlying codebase.  We'd be quite excited to see these used to solve interesting
problems.
