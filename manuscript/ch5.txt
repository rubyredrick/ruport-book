== Ad-hoc Reporting with +rope+ ==

In the last few chapters, you've seen how deeply Ruport can be extended.
You've also probably caught a glimpse of how it is reasonably easy to get
everything wired up in Rails application without acquiring a tacked-on feel.

In this chapter, we'll turn all of those concepts on their head, and cover what
Ruport was originally designed for: quick and dirty ad-hoc reporting.  Though
the following example has been simplified to make it easier on the eyes, I'm
sure you can imagine plenty of scenarios where you want a quick CSV report
without much hassle, and that's what you'll see how to do here.

We're going to take a look at how to use ruport-util's code generator, +rope+,
to quickly generate configuration files and reports for a standalone 
environment.  We'll then make loose ties back into our Rails application so we
can still make use of our models there.  Once we get things set up, we'll create
a simple report which compares our data from PayR to a MySQL database that
contains appointment data.

Our report will show us when scheduled vacation days in PayR conflict with
employee appointments.  The output format will be a simple CSV of names and 
dates, which will be emailed to managers on a nightly basis.  Though we could
have done all of this within our Rails application, the idea here is we may
end up doing a whole lot more of these ad-hoc reports, and we want them to be
largely independent of the Rails app itself for simplicity.
         
=== Generating and Configuring a +rope+ Application ===    
         
We start by running the +rope+ command and creating a simple skeleton in the +lib/+
directory of PayR.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------           
$ rope lib/nightly_reports
creating directories..
  lib/nightly_reports/test
  lib/nightly_reports/config
  lib/nightly_reports/output
  lib/nightly_reports/data
  lib/nightly_reports/data/models
  lib/nightly_reports/lib
  lib/nightly_reports/lib/reports
  lib/nightly_reports/lib/controllers
  lib/nightly_reports/sql
  lib/nightly_reports/util
creating files..
  lib/nightly_reports/lib/reports.rb
  lib/nightly_reports/lib/helpers.rb
  lib/nightly_reports/lib/controllers.rb
  lib/nightly_reports/lib/templates.rb
  lib/nightly_reports/lib/init.rb
  lib/nightly_reports/config/environment.rb
  lib/nightly_reports/util/build
  lib/nightly_reports/util/sql_exec
  lib/nightly_reports/Rakefile
  lib/nightly_reports/README  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We now need to configure our database connections and set up a mail server.
We do this in the projects +config/environment.rb+.  Keep in mind that
this is your +rope+ application's environment file, not the Rails app.

Let's look at the full config file first, then we'll check it out piece by 
piece in more detail.
                    
*+lib/nightly_reports/config/environment.rb+*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  require "ruport"    

  RAILS_ROOT = File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../../.."

  Ruport::Query.add_source :default, :user => "root",
                                     :dsn  => "dbi:mysql:dental_db"  


  Ruport::Mailer.add_mailer(:default,
    :host => "smtp.gmail.com",
    :address => "test@gmail.com",
    :user => "test@gmail.com",
    :password => "alpha123",
    :auth_type => :plain,
    :port => 587      
  )              
 
  require "active_record"
  require "ruport/acts_as_reportable"

  require "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/environment"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We first establish the location of the root of our rails app as a convenience.
Since this isn't done for us by +rope+, we need to define it ourselves:

  RAILS_ROOT = File.dirname(__FILE__) + "/../../.."   
 
We then establish our connection to a MySQL database.  Though configuration
details can get more interesting than this, we're using the most simple case 
here:

  Ruport::Query.add_source :default, :user => "root",
                                     :dsn  => "dbi:mysql:dental_db"

Since Ruport uses RubyDBI under the hood, the DSN is just a string that DBI uses
to establish a connection.  Here we're telling it to use the MySQL driver, and
attach to a database called +dental_db+ on the localhost using the MySQL
root user.              

From here, we establish our SMTP settings, since we'll be mailing the report
automatically:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Ruport::Mailer.add_mailer(:default,
    :host => "smtp.gmail.com",
    :address => "test@gmail.com",
    :user => "test@gmail.com",
    :password => "alpha123",
    :auth_type => :plain,
    :port => 587      
  )              
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This shows pretty much every option you might need to establish an SMTP 
connection.  Your actual configuration may be much more simple.  However, the
fact that we're using GMail complicates things a bit, and though we won't go into
details here, you can check +lib/init.rb+ for details footnote:[+Net::SMTP+ has some issues, which
are addressed by a monkey-patch from Stephen Chu. We found this fix at: http://www.stephenchu.com/2006/06/how-to-use-gmail-smtp-server-to-send.html].

Once we've established our email settings, we take a little shortcut to get our
app working with our Rails models:
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  require "active_record"
  require "ruport/acts_as_reportable"

  require "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/environment"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This establishes a connection to the Rails database and lets us skip a bunch of
hard wiring of model files and manual loading of dependencies.  It's certainly
a hack, so your mileage may vary.  You'll need to set your RAILS_ENV environment 
variable in whatever script ultimately runs the scheduled report, but it will 
default to development, which is what we're looking for at this point anyway. 

With all of this stuff together, we can do a quick sanity check to make sure
things are working:
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ irb -Ilib -rlib/init

>> puts Ruport::Query.new("describe appointments").result
+------------------------------------------------------------+
|      Field       |   Type   | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
| provider_id      | char(20) | YES  |     |         |       |
| patient_id       | int(11)  | YES  |     |         |       |
| appointment_time | datetime | YES  |     |         |       |
+------------------------------------------------------------+
=> nil      

>> Employee.column_names
=> ["id", "first_name", "last_name", "username", ...]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perfect!  Shows that both our raw access to the MySQL database and the hooks
into our Rails application are working.  We can now move on to bigger and better
things.

=== Developing a Simple CSV Report ===

Applications generated with +rope+ have a Rakefile based interface, so
we can use that to generate our report file.   
       
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ rake build report=vacation

reports file: lib/reports/vacation.rb
test file: test/test_vacation.rb
class name: Vacation
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This simply generates a place for tests and a simple boilerplate file for a
report.  Actually, +rope+ can generate a lot more stuff footnote:[See the +rope+ cheatsheet, starting on page XXX], but this is all we'll
need for now.

The report definition is quite minimal at first, looking like this:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  require "lib/init"
  class Vacation < Ruport::Report

    def renderable_data(format)

    end

  end
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 

If you've worked with +Ruport::Controller::Hooks+ footnote:[Custom Controller Logic, Section __, Page ___] before, this might look
somewhat familiar.  However, if you haven't, no worries.

We can start with a simple example to help clarify things, then take a look at
the full report.
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
require "lib/init"
class Vacation < Ruport::Report
   
  renders_as_table

  def renderable_data(format)
     Table(%w[a b c]) << [1,2,3] << [4,5,6]
  end
  
end 

Vacation.generate do |report| 
  report.save_as "output/vacation.csv" 
  report.send_to("gregory.t.brown@gmail.com") do |m|
    m.subject = "Vacation Conflicts Report"
    m.attach "output/vacation.csv"
  end
end 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you can see here, the +Ruport::Report+ class just provides some helper
methods to make producing reports a little easier.

The first thing to notice is our +renders_as_table+ call.  What we are
telling our report object here is that it will pass the results of 
+renderable_data+ to Ruport's table controller.  This means it expects
the return value to be a +Ruport::Data::Table+, 
or at least duck type as one.  

Here we just use the defacto-standard Ruport junk data to show it's hooked up:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  def renderable_data(format)
     Table(%w[a b c]) << [1,2,3] << [4,5,6]
  end
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we wanted to use a different controller, there are macros defined for those
as well:
  
  * +renders_as_row+
  * +renders_as_group+
  * +renders_as_grouping+
  * +renders_as_graph+ (via ruport-util)

You can also use any controller you'd like, via the +renders_with()+ command.  In
the spirit of keeping things simple, we'll stick with table rendering for now.

The final bit of this simplified report is the code that actually generates and
emails the CSV:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Vacation.generate do |report| 
    report.save_as "output/vacation.csv" 
    report.send_to("gregory.t.brown@gmail.com") do |m|
      m.subject = "Vacation Conflicts Report"
      m.attach "output/vacation.csv"
    end
  end
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As you've seen in previous examples, Ruport is capable of inferring which 
formatter to used based on the file name you give it. The code here simply tells
Ruport to render a CSV from the results of +renderable_data+, and then
email it as an attachment to the address specified.

If we wanted to do some format-specific hackery, we could use the +format+
argument passed to +renderable_data+ which in this case would evaluate to +:csv+.
Though this can be handy, we won't need it here, so we'll leave that as an 
exercise to the reader.

If you wanted to try this report out, it's already functional, and you can run
it via rake:

  $ rake run report=vacation

This will produce a file in the +output+ folder with a rather trivial CSV:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
a,b,c
1,2,3
4,5,6
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This file will also be emailed to the address we specified to +send_to()+.

If you've understood the code so far, you'll have no trouble understanding the
real report, which just adds some business logic and database access on top of
this basic idea of report objects.  Let's take a look at it as a whole and then
break it down:
     
*+lib/nightly_reports/lib/reports/vacation.rb+*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  require "lib/init"          
  class Vacation < Ruport::Report

    renders_as_table

    def renderable_data(format)  
      Table("Employee", "Conflicted Date") do |csv_out|   
        payr_data.each do |employee_id, data|
          times = scheduling_data_for_employee(employee_id)    
          conflicts = data.select { |r| times.include?(r.date) } 
          conflicts.each { |r| csv_out << [r["employee.name"], r["date"]] }
        end      
      end      
    end                                                

    def payr_data  
      Grouping(
        OtherTime.report_table(:all,
          :conditions => ["category = 'Vacation' and date between ? and ?",
                        1.day.from_now, 7.days.from_now],
          :include => { :employee => { :methods => "name" } },
          :transforms => lambda { |r| r["date"] = r["date"].to_date } ), 
        :by => "employee.employee_id")   
    end

    def scheduling_data_for_employee(eid)      
      result = query "select provider_id, appointment_time from appointments where 
                      provider_id = ? and appointment_time between ? and ?",
                        :params => [eid,1.day.from_now, 7.days.from_now]

      result.map { |e| e["appointment_time"].to_date }
    end

  end

  Vacation.generate do |report|
    report.save_as "output/vacation_conflicts.csv"           
    report.send_to "gregory.t.brown@gmail.com" do |m|
      m.subject = "Vacation Conflicts"   
      m.attach "output/vacation_conflicts.csv"  
    end
  end
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Working from the high level down, let's take a look at what our +renderable_data+
code is doing:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  def renderable_data(format)  
    Table("Employee", "Conflicted Date") do |csv_out|   
      payr_data.each do |employee_id, data|
        times = scheduling_data_for_employee(employee_id)    
        conflicts = data.select { |r| times.include?(r.date) } 
        conflicts.each { |r| csv_out << [r["employee.name"], r["date"]] }
      end      
    end      
  end
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can see right away this is just producing a two field table and returning it:   

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Table("Employee", "Conflicted Date") do |csv_out|   
    # ...
  end 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This approach of building up a table within a block is mostly just syntactic
sugar, allowing us to never explicitly assign our table object to a variable,
since it is immediately passed to the controller.

When we look at the code that's actually populating the table, we find that it's
pretty simple:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  payr_data.each do |employee_id, data|
    times = scheduling_data_for_employee(employee_id)    
    conflicts = data.select { |r| times.include?(r.date) } 
    conflicts.each { |r| csv_out << [r["employee.name"], r["date"]] }
  end
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The +payr_data+ helper returns a grouping object, which is basically vacation
time records grouped by employee_id.  For each employee, we pull a list of 
appointment dates via the +scheduling_data_for_employee+ helper.

We then select any vacation times which conflict with these appointments, and
add a row with the employee name and the vacation date to the table.  If this 
seems somewhat simple, you won't find the actual database interaction code much
harder.

Let's take a look at our ActiveRecord interactions first, which we find in 
+payr_data+.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
  def payr_data  
    Grouping(
      OtherTime.report_table(:all,
        :conditions => ["category = 'Vacation' and date between ? and ?",
                       1.day.from_now, 7.days.from_now],
        :include => { :employee => { :methods => "name" } },
        :transforms => lambda { |r| r["date"] = r["date"].to_date } ), 
      :by => "employee.employee_id")   
  end
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Because this is an ad-hoc report, we are coding a little quicker and dirtier
than we might if it were a full scale application. In the code above, the first
thing to notice is that it is simply doing a grouping by the employee_id field.

 Grouping(some_table, :by => "employee.employee_id")
 
In this context, the +some_table+ data is just results from a vanilla +report_table+
call via Ruport's acts_as_reportable.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OtherTime.report_table(:all,
  :conditions => ["category = 'Vacation' and date between ? and ?",
                 1.day.from_now, 7.days.from_now],
  :include => { :employee => { :methods => "name" } },
  :transforms => lambda { |r| r["date"] = r["date"].to_date } 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Here we are just pulling vacation times within a certain date range, asking for
it to include the employee association information, and doing a quick 
transformation from datetime objects to dates, which is necessary to make 
comparisons later.

From here, you end up with a simple grouping of vacation times by employee_id
that include the rest of an employee's information.  We can now look at the SQL
we use to interact with our MySQL database which is not part of the PayR 
application.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  def scheduling_data_for_employee(eid)      
    result = query "select appointment_time from appointments where 
                    provider_id = ? and appointment_time between ? and ?",
                      :params => [eid,1.day.from_now, 7.days.from_now]

    result.map { |e| e["appointment_time"].to_date }
  end
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This code is even eaiser than the PayR data code.  It simply looks up 
appointment times for a given time period and employee id (called provider_id in
our MySQL database).

It's worth noting that if the query became larger than a couple lines, Ruport
understands +query "path/to/my_file.sql"+, among other things.  For our
needs however, this is more than enough.

When we run this report, we end up with a barebones CSV that shows our
conflicting Vacation dates.  Output will look something like this:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Employee,Conflicted Date 
Gregory Brown,2007-11-29
Gregory Gibson,2007-12-01  
Gregory Gibson,2007-12-02 
Joe Loop,2007-12-03
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We can of course, change this output to HTML, PDF, or Text by changing exactly
two lines:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Vacation.generate do |report|
    report.save_as "output/vacation_conflicts.txt"           
    report.send_to "gregory.t.brown@gmail.com" do |m|
      m.subject = "Vacation Conflicts"   
      m.attach "output/vacation_conflicts.txt"  
    end
  end 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is one of the many nice things about working with Ruport as opposed to
writing one-off scripts that you soon need to throw away rather than build on
top of.

Now all that remains for this report is to use your favorite scheduling 
software, perhaps +cron+, to fire this on a nightly basis.  Though we won't
discuss it here, it's usually as simple as just running the Rakefile with any
necessary environment variables.

Hopefully this gives you a taste of how +rope+ applications work, and how you 
can sneak them in to live alongside Rails apps.  Some people love this kind of
stuff, others prefer to keep tight integration in their Rails app and wouldn't
want to layer something like this into their projects.  We really leave that
decision up to you, by design.

When you're using a rope-based Ruport application, it's easy to
re-use configuration information, make reports build off of each other, and
also keep your reporting code cleanly separated from the rest of your 
application.  If you end up with situations where that is important, you might
consider using some of the techniques shown here.
            
=== And That's the End of That Chapter ===

With this, we come to the end of our discussion of PayR.  We encourage you to
poke around in the source files, because we haven't covered absolutely every 
use of Ruport, probably not even _most_ of the uses.  However, we hope we've
given you a strong sense of not just the syntax and raw functionality pertaining
to Ruport, but also how we develop applications using it.

Though we'll happily admit there are a lot of valid approaches to using Ruport,
we think that the toolset best reflects how we are using it. If you've gained
some insight from this discussion about that, we think you'll find your work a
whole lot easier. 

The remainder of the book is a collection of more nuts-and-bolts material. 
 
We've compiled several cheatsheets about common Ruport topics, which are 
designed to be both a quick reference guide and a way to explore features you
have not yet worked with.  We hope that combined with the detailed 
explainations of PayR, these cheatsheets will provide a solid base for using
Ruport in your day to day work.
